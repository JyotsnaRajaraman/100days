# Nand2Tetris Code Starters

This is the code from my progression in the Nand2tetris project, which I think is a great resource to learn and understand the basics of Computer Systems quickly and efficiently. And while not all of the code is included - it is intended that way to leave some of the fun to the reader. I had a lot of fun following this resource from beginning to end and would love for everyone else who is also discovering this to do the same. 

# Marie Curie, a wise woman that I admire said “Nothing in life is to be feared, it is only to be understood. Now is the time to understand more, so that we may fear less.” 

And true to that Computers are something anyone can understand the working of and with just a littel dedication and effort - the Nand2tetris projects shows you exactly how to do that

So have fun exploring the project at Nand2Tetris (https://www.nand2tetris.org/)!!
