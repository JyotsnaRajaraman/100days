Program (written in Python) is the full Virtual Machine Language Translator, and in addition to the implementation of the stack arithmetic and memory access commands of the VM language, it can now also handle the VM language's branching and function calling commands.

The driver.py file is the main module that can be run from the command line by using the python command as well as providing an input folder as argument. The .asm file will be placed in the input directory with the same name as the input directory.

For example to run a file from the terminal, you can use 

python driver.py StaticsTest


where StaticsTest is the directory containing the input .vm files
